# Resume

This is my personal up-to-date resume. It is written in LaTeX and uses Posquit0's [Awesome CV](https://github.com/posquit0/Awesome-CV) as a base template.

## Compilation

Typing `xelatex resume.tex` into a terminal will compile the project into PDF form. This requires an installation of TeX Live, which can be installed on debian-based distros with `sudo apt-get install texlive-full`.
